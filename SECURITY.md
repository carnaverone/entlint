# Security Policy

**Intended use:** defensive scanning of source code you own or are authorized to audit.

- Do **not** scan data you are not allowed to access.
- The tool is offline-only and prints **metadata** (path/line/entropy) by default.
- Optional `--preview` shows a **redacted** snippet (no alphanumerics).

## Reporting
Report security issues privately:
- Email: security@example.com (replace)
